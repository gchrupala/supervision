Thesis guidelines
=================

- Consider learning and using the Latex typesetting system to prepare your thesis.
- The thesis length should be around 15000 words.
- A thesis typically has structure similar to this:

  - Introduction - explain briefly what your research questions are,
    why they are important, how you approached them and what your
    findings were 
  - Background - explain the larger scientific context of the problem:
    what is the theory behind it if any, and what previous research
    has been done related to it. Flesh out research questions 
  - Methods - describe your approach, for example which mathematical
    models or computational algorithms you used 
  - Data and Experiments - describe how you obtained or collected your
    data and provide summary statistics. Describe your experimental
    setup (data preprocessing, model choice/parameters etc).  
  - Results - specify the settings of the final model. Report the
    quantitative results you obtained on the final test set. 
  - Discussion - interpret the results and include error analysis or
    other qualitative analysis (with examples). Discuss relation to
    other research 
  - Conclusion - summarize main findings and indicate future
    directions of research 

- This typical structure can be reordered and modified if appropriate
  for your specific project. 
- The thesis should have a title page, table of contents at the
  beginning and references at the end. 
- Chapters should be divided into sections and subsections and
  numbered as X.Y.Z 
- Detailed descriptions of particular software implementations used
  for the research are typically not necessary. If given, they should
  be in the section on the exprimental setup.  
- The  main final results may be presented in the form of a table with
  precise numbers. Exploratory data analysis and intermediate results
  are often best reported in the form of charts and plots. 
- Use a Author-Date format such as APA for citations, and a uniform
  consistent style for references. Specify the same information for
  the same type of bibliographical entries.
- Any tables with data longer than about 10-15 rows should be put in
  appendices or supplementary material. 
- **Never submit any draft or version containing unacknowledged quotes
  or paraphrases.** 
- Do not reuse any figures or other images without a proper license or
  a permission of the author of the original. In all cases credit
  images to the the author.
