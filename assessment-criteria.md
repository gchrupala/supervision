MSc Thesis Assessment Criteria
==============================

Research Question

:   Is the subject clearly delineated? Is the central research question
    introduced in a clear and analytically skilled way? Is the research
    question formulated clearly and succinctly? Are the concepts used
    formulated and defined clearly? Is the societal and scientific
    relevance of the research question argued/demonstrated adequately?
    Is adequate justification given for the choices made in formulating
    the research question? Is the problem posed relevant, subject of
    debate and original?

Theory and Literature

:   Is the theory dealt with relevant in the framework of the research
    question? Is the literature of recent date? Do the component
    questions link up well with the central research question? Is the
    theory dealt with representative? Is the scientific level of the
    theory sufficient? Is a critical attitude taken in processing the
    literature (identifying relationships, contradictions, gaps or
    inconsistencies in the literature)?

Method

:   Is the description of the method(s) clear and adequate? Is a further
    explanation/clarification given why this method was chosen rather
    than others? Is the research set-up valid and sufficiently specific
    considering the research question? Is data collection performed
    adequately (operationalization of concepts, instrumentation,
    research techniques, choice of the empirical field)?

Results

:   Are the results – qualitative or quantitative – presented in an
    orderly fashion, according to an ordering principle properly
    specified? Are tables, figures, diagrams or overviews used in a
    well-considered way? Are the data analyzed further using qualitative
    and/or quantitative analyzing techniques that fit the research
    method(s) chosen? Is there a certain originality of the methodology
    applied in the candidate’s own research? Is the research merely
    descriptive or is there in-depth analysis as well?

Conclusion and Discussion

:   Are there clear and well-founded conclusions? Do the results and the
    conclusions link up well with the research question? Is there
    feedback to the theory? Are any cross-connections made? Do the
    conclusions provide a clear answer to the various (component)
    questions and hypotheses? Does the thesis yield new insights? Is
    attention paid to the generalizability of the results, and the
    practical and theoretical implications of the conclusions? Is a
    critical attitude taken and expressed with regard to the research
    conducted and the results found? Are there suggestions for further
    research and new research questions formulated?

Structure

:   Is the thesis and its component parts structured clearly and
    logically? Is there a clear cohesion between the various parts? Is
    every part structured in a well-balanced and clear way? Are main
    issues clearly separated from side issues? Is there a proper balance
    between the total size of the thesis and its relevant content? Is
    the thesis conceived independently, or is it a collection of studies
    and quotations?

Form and Presentation

:   Is the length/number of pages in accordance with the prescribed
    norms (CIW-Bachelor’s thesis: approx. 12,500 words, CIW-Master’s
    thesis: approx. 15,000 words, excluding table of contents,
    bibliography and appendices)? Does this size fit the content? Are
    there many or few typographical or stylistic errors? Does the text
    read well? How is the quality of the written language (style, choice
    of words, spelling, etc.)? Is adequate use made of notes and/or
    appendices? Are the quotations, references and sources cited correct
    and complete? Is the bibliography ok? Is the division into
    paragraphs and sections consistent? Is the quality of the
    summary/abstract ok?
