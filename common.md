# Common issues with theses and papers

- *Machine learning* is a generic term which includes *deep learning*. Do not make a use *machine learning* to mean "learning methods except neural networks". 
- Avoid vague terms like *traditional ML* or *traditional NLP*. Just name the specific method you are referring to.
- Make sure to use English number formatting: decimal POINT, and comma as thousand separator (i.e. 1.2 and 10,000)
- Formulas:
  * Whenever you include a formula, explain the meaning of the symbols used. 
  * Do not include formaulas you do not understand yourself. 
  * Do not include formulas unless they are important to understanding some part of your work.
- Detailed descriptions of particular software implementations used
  for the research are typically not necessary. If given, they should
  be in the section on the experimental setup.  
- The  main final results may be presented in the form of a table with
  precise numbers. Exploratory data analysis and intermediate results
  are often best reported in the form of charts and plots. 
- Any tables with data longer than about 10-15 rows should be put in
  appendices or supplementary material.
