Practical info on MSc theses projects
-------------------------------------

- If you'd like to aim for a thesis grade above 8.0, keep in mind that in general 
  you'll need to do publication-grade research. Discuss your ambitions with 
  from the very start.
- If you're doing your thesis with an external partner, be aware that the thesis needs to be 
  scientific in nature, and that this consideration may be in conflict with the partner's preferences. 
  Make sure your host institution understands this also.
- We'll have regular face-to-face meetings. If appropriate, in small
  groups of students.
- In order for a meeting to be scheduled, I need to first receive an email with a report of 
  your progress to date, and a list of questions or problems to be discussed at 
  the meeting. Use plain text or PDF for your reports.

- Remember that the thesis is meant to be your own work. Specifically:
  
    - There are no multiple rounds of detailed feedback. You will get high-
      level feedback for the draft of the full thesis. 
      Make sure you only send in work which is reasonably complete and proofread.
    - Be very careful about following rules about properly referencing
      and attributing material. Plagiarism is a serious offense.
    - If collaborating, indicate clearly which work was done by someone else.
    - You supervisor will be helping you, but is not supposed to:

        - rewrite your text to fix quality problems
        - write, test or debug code for your project
        - run statistical tests
        
- Keep track of all the data and code needed to reproduce your
  results. Consider using version control software for this
  purpose (e.g. Github). Final version of the thesis document should contain
  instructions about obtaining the data and code needed to reproduce
  your work.
