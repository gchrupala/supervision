Practical info on MSc theses projects
-------------------------------------

- If you'd like to aim for a thesis grade above 8.0, keep in mind that in general 
  you'll need to do publication-grade research. Discuss your ambitions with 
  your supervisor from the very start.
- Prepare a brief (1-2 pages) proposal outlining your research
  questions and methology within the first two weeks.
- We'll have regular face-to-face meetings. If appropriate, in small
  groups of students.
- Two working days before each meeting you should submit a report on
  your progress, or in the later stages, a section of your thesis
  which is ready for review (in PDF format).
- You will get feedback for each chapter once, and another time for
  the draft of the full thesis. Make sure you only send in work which
  is reasonably complete and proofread.
- Roughly half-way through youâ€™ll prepare a full project proposal on
  the basis of which your supervisor and second reader will decide
  whether you may proceed with your thesis work (go-nogo).
- Remember that the thesis is meant to be your own work. Specifically:
  
    - Be very careful about following rules about properly referencing
      and attributing material. Plagiarism is a serious offense.
    - If collaborating, indicate clearly which work was done by someone else.
    - You supervisor will be helping you, but is not supposed to:

        - rewrite your text to fix quality problems
        - write, test or debugging code for your project
        - run statistical tests

- Full draft of the thesis is due six weeks before planned graduation ceremony.
- Keep track of all the data and code needed to reproduce your
  results. Consider using version control software for this
  purpose. Final version of the thesis document should contain
  instructions about obtaining the data and code needed to reproduce
  your work.
