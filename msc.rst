Practical info on MSc theses projects
-------------------------------------

- It is your responsibility to familiarize yourself with the requirements of the thesis component of your degree. 
  You need to keep track of all the deadlines yourself and make sure you submit all deliverables on time. 
- If you'd like to aim for a thesis grade above 8.0, keep in mind that in general you'll need to do publication-grade research. 
- If you're doing your thesis with an external partner, be aware that the thesis needs to be 
  scientific in nature, and that this consideration may be in conflict with the partner's preferences. 
  Make sure your host institution understands this also. 
- We'll have regular face-to-face group meetings. You'll get the most from them if you come prepared. In general, there will be no individual meetings.
- Remember that the thesis is meant to be your own work. You will get some guidance but no detailed instructions about what to do. Specifically, there are no multiple rounds of detailed written feedback. You will get high-level oral feedback based on your questions and comments during group meetings. Make sure to take notes.
- Be very careful about following rules about properly referencing and attributing material. Plagiarism is a serious offense.
- If collaborating with another student or an external party, indicate clearly which work was done by someone else.      
- Keep track of all the data and code needed to reproduce your
  results. Consider using version control software for this
  purpose (e.g. Github). Final version of the thesis document should contain
  instructions about obtaining the data and code needed to reproduce
  your work.
