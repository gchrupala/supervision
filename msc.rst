Practical info on MSc theses projects
-------------------------------------


- Topics: in general you can work on any topic I'm qualified to supervise, but you will get the most of my feedback if it's something close to my  domain of expertise. Check my website: https://grzegorz.chrupala.me for my research interests. 

   * If your topic is to predict cryptocurrency / stock / commodity prices  or similar from easily available information (such as Twitter sentiment), you will have to work very hard to convince me that this makes sense, so please reconsider.

- Keep in mind that it will be hard to write a good thesis if your main dataset is tabular and small in size in terms of rows and/or features. In general, Data Science methods are most applicable and you have the most chance to demonstrate DS expertise when working with multiple, large scale, unstructured or semi-structured datasets.

- One of the most important considerations when chosing and preparing data for your project it that it should enable you to carry out quantitative evaluation. Specifically, you need to obtain or create prepare enough high quality, reliably labeled data to use as a test set. 

- It is your responsibility to familiarize yourself with the requirements of the thesis component of your degree. 
  You need to keep track of all the deadlines yourself and make sure you submit all deliverables on time. 

- If you're doing your thesis with an external partner, be aware that the thesis needs to be 
  scientific in nature, and that this consideration may be in conflict with the partner's preferences. 
  Make sure your host institution understands this also. Also be aware that university staff will not sign non-disclosure agreements. You need to make sure that you are allowed to provide all necessary information to your supervisor.
  
- We'll have regular group meetings. You'll get the most from them if you come prepared. There will be no individual meetings.
- Remember that the thesis is meant to be your own work. You will get some guidance but no detailed instructions about what to do. Specifically, there are no multiple rounds of detailed written feedback. You will get high-level oral feedback based on your questions and comments during group meetings. Make sure to take notes.
- Be very careful about following rules about properly referencing and attributing material. Plagiarism is a serious offense.
- If collaborating with an external party, indicate clearly which work was done by someone else.      
- Keep track of all the data and code needed to reproduce your
  results. Consider using version control software for this
  purpose (e.g. Github). Final version of the thesis document should contain
  instructions about obtaining the data and code needed to reproduce
  your work.
